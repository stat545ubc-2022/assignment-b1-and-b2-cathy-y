The goal of cathystat545 is to calculate the frequency of each level in a factor-type column of a data frame and report the most frequently occurring level.

## Installation

You can install the development version of cathystat545 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("stat545ubc-2022/assignment-b1-and-b2-cathy-y")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(cathystat545)

sample_df <- data.frame("cake" = c("red velvet", "red velvet", "vanilla", "chocolate", "red velvet", "red velvet"),
                        "client" = c("client 1", "client 1", "client 2", "client 2", "client 3", "client 3"),
                        "cost" = c(12, 12, 14.50, 10.25, 12, 12))
sample_df$cake <- as.factor(sample_df$cake)

most_frequent(sample_df, "cake")
```
